BOOM BOT v6.6.6
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>*/

	A bot for turntable.fm
	Dj, welcome users,
	Call out haters, etc

/*<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
Requirements
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>*/

Node.js
NPM
ttapi - https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API
ntwitter (if you want auto tweets) - https://github.com/AvianFlu/ntwitter

/*<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
Setup
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>*/

once you have node running, npm,
and the ttapi installed:

Create a FB or twitter account for your new bot.
Log in as the bot and use this to get your bots uid, auth token, and your rooms id:
http://alaingilbert.github.com/Turntable-API/bookmarklet.html
Now use the same method to get your personal accounts user id for control of the bot

Open boombot.js in Sublime text 2 (Or your editor of choice... but really... go get sublime... its great..)
replace the xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx's with your auth, bot id, and your own personal user id. 
each section that requires these are appropriately commented to tell you where to enter them.

There will also be a few places where you will replace the text YourUserName with your own so the bot will express its love for you.

Add to the arrays anything you want to add or change. Would be nice of you to keep the url to obtain your own copy under the 
/boombot command, but I won't hunt you down if you want it to go.

path to the saved location,
node boombot.js

Auto tweeting the current song
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>*/

This feature is commented out by default for people who could care less about twitter. To use, read below and uncomment the twitter area at the bottom of the boombot.js file.

Create a twitter acct if you don't already have one.
Then go to dev.twitter.com and sign in with that acct and enable it for development.
Create a new twitter application. VERY IMPORTANT: BEFORE you request your Oauth tokens set the app to read + write or read + write + direct message. 
Once you have your token keys, add them to the appropriatelly commented areas at the bottom of the file.

The bot will now tweet the current track and artist with a #Turntablefm hashtag.

Notes
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>*/

I know nothing about node. This was a playground that seemed to be liked. No warranties, no guarantees. I will however help you to the best that I can if you have any issues or find any bugs.

If you're more experienced than I am and want to tell me how to make this better in any way. I am all ears. Fell free to fork, if you come up with some cool scripts you can request a pull back and I will add them.

Lastly, ENJOY IT!!!!! It's not the best or most feature filled bot, but I appreciate you using him! 
Come check out my personal bot @TerrorBot on twitter and in http://turntable.fm/while_icode_dropbeatz_infinite_muzik where he lives.
